    <h1>Don't get too excited</h1>
    My experience with coding is modest. I took one introductory programming course while I was working on my Bachelor's.
    The course I took covered Python, and I REALLY really liked it. However, I knew that if I were to go into the industry,
    I would need to work in languages that were much less user friendly. Because of this, I decided to try Java online
    through some free-to-use websites. The challenge seemed to make the process of learning even more enjoyable to me,
    so I continued working with it for fun, and I began to realize that I would prefer to be learning coding than
    continue to learn about medicine.

    I've created programs similar to the prework, lots of games, and some programs that manipulated photos.
    I would like to create programs that are useful to me in my everyday life, as well as programs that would help future
    employers (or at least showcase my abilities).
