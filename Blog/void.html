      <h1>I have been living in ignorance of this fact for a while now</h1>
      Today I learned that the "void" in the declaration of a method is there to
      let the compiler know that you won't be returning any variable from this
      class to another one. If the method were created to return a new variable,
      say an integer, you would replace the void with an "int".
