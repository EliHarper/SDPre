      <h1>They're classes!</h1>
      When you include a line of code such as "import java.util.Scanner;" in your program,
      you're essentially telling the program to import - or to bring a package in from another folder.
      So, in your computer's java directory, there is another directory named util (utilities) that
      contains the functionality for a lot of built-in classes. Scanner specifically contains the functionality
      to read system input.
